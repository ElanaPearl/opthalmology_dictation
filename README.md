**Benchmarking our software against whisper**
To deploy OpenAI's whisper transcription function, 
1) create a conda environment using environment.yml. 
2) Run whisper_function.py after generating your open AI api key.
3) Run transcript.py to generate transcripts using all the recordings in the "recordings" file

**looking at Charater Error Rate**
Character error rate is calculated using the generated transcripts and provided short-form synthetic data
in the class google doc.
