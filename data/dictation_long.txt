Right Eye (OD): Weiss ring, optic nerve cupping, arteries and veins are of normal caliber, geographic atrophy in the fovea and parafovea, nasal subretinal scar/fluid and the peripheral retina appears normal where visible. Left Eye (OS): Weiss ring, optic nerve is cupped in appearance, arteries and veins are of normal caliber, geographic atrophy in the fovea and parafovea, nasal parafoveal choroidal neovascularization, and the peripheral retina appears normal where visible. Interpretation: geographic atrophy and quiescent exudative age-related macular degeneration, right eye; active exudative age-related macular degeneration, left eye
Right Eye (OD): Weiss ring, optic nerve is cupped in appearance, arteries and veins are of normal caliber, macula appears flat and the peripheral retina appears normal where visible. Left Eye (OS): Weiss ring, trace vitreous hemorrhage, optic nerve cupping, sclerotic vessels and tortuous veins superotemporal, macula appears flat and  the peripheral retina appears ischemic in the superotemporal periphery with grid laser scars in areas of ischemia, few adjacent intraretinal hemorrhages. Interpretation: branch retinal vein occlusion status status post grid laser, with vitreous hemorrhage, left eye
Right Eye (OD): Weiss ring, peripapillary atrophy and optic nerve tilt, attenuated arterioles, patchy atrophy and there is an area of elevation in the inferotemporal near periphery with no breaks (increased to prior) with subretinal hemorrhage adjacent resolved, there is temporal and inferior cobblestone atrophy. Left Eye (OS): Weiss ring, peripapillary atrophy and optic nerve tilt, attenuated arterioles, patchy atrophy and  RPE hyperpigmentation in the inferior perifovea and temporal near-periphery, temporal and inferior cobblestone atrophy. Interpretation: peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy, right eye; pathologic myopia, both eyes
Right Eye (OD): No view through gas. Left Eye (OS): Media is clear, optic nerve is normal in appearance, arteries and veins are of normal caliber, macula appears flat and the peripheral retina appears normal where visible. Interpretation: no view due to intraocular gas following repair of retinal detachment, right eye; normal fundus, left eye
